# AI folder

This folder is for machine-focused/LLM/automation artifacts that help maintain continuity across sessions.

- Not intended for publishing or human-facing docs.
- Safe to ignore in release archives and web publishing.
- May include metadata and caches that assist automated tools.

Files
- `workshop.edn` — machine-readable metadata for the workshop.
- `assistant-preferences.edn` — behavior preferences (consent-first, supportive role, no notebook edits without request).

Notes
- If you prefer a hidden directory, we can rename this to `.llm/` or `.eca/` later.
